PREFACE AND FOREWORD 
 
All praise and thanks be to Allah, the God Almighty due to His grace and guidance, 
INTRAC based on mandate of the Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security 
Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia as the Chief of Money Laundering Committee has a role 
as the Leading Sector in preparation of updating National Risk Assessment on Money 
Laundering by coordinating more of 15 (fifteen) Ministries/Institutions in Anti-Money 
Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation  (AML-CFT) Regime 
in Indonesia as members of “Inter Agency Working Group NRA Indonesia 2021”. 
Preparation of a National Risk Assessment on Money Laundering in Indonesia is not a 
new issue. Indonesia has carried out its first NRA assessment in 2015 and a consolidated 
Updated NRA assessment 2015 has been carried out on various risk assessments and white 
papers for period 2015 to 2019. 
This condition shows that the Government of Indonesia has an extraordinarily strong 
commitment in preventing and eradicating Money Laundering. Various steps to strengthen 
Indonesia's commitment have been implemented in an integrated manner through National 
Policy Strategy for Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering in Indonesia. As a 
concrete form of Implementation of the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations (FATF 
Recommendation) No. 1 and responding to the evaluation notes in the 2018 APG Mutual 
Evaluation Review as well as the domestic need in determining national directions and policies, 
INTRAC together with the stakeholders of the AML-CFT regime carry out an Indonesian Risk 


Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | x  
Assessment on Money Laundering in the form of a National Risk Assessment on Money 
Laundering Activity (NRA on ML) 2021. 
I welcome preparation of the 2021 NRA on ML update document because it is especially 
important for all stakeholders of the AML-CFT regime, in order to identify, analyze, and 
evaluate various domestic and international money laundering risks (inward risk and outward 
risk), includes predicate offenses, profiles, industrial sectors, typology and geographical areas. 
This document is expected to be utilized by various key stakeholders, particularly in: 
1. Providing input for potential improvements to the AML regime, including through the 
formulation of risk-based mitigation policies (National Strategy for Money Laundering 
Prevention and Eradication); 
2. Assisting the government and relevant stakeholders in prioritizing and allocating 
resources for Risk-Based Anti-Money Laundering. 
3. Providing input on money laundering risk assessment conducted by various related 
sectors such as Risk Based Investigation by Law Enforcement Agencies, Risk Based 
Supervision by Self-regulatory bodies, and Risk Based Approach by Reporting Parties. 
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the NRA INTRAC Team 
and all stakeholders of the AML-CFT regime who are members of the Inter-Agency Working 
Group of NRA Indonesia who have contributed to preparation of the Indonesian Risk 
Assessment on Money Laundering in 2021. We are blessed by Allah SWT. Amen Ya Rabbal 
'Alamin.

xi | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2022 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The update of National Risk 
Assessment on Criminal Acts of Holistic 
Money Laundering (ML) in 2021 is an 
important and relevant step to respond to 
the dynamic development of national and 
international needs. By using a risk 
assessment 
formulation 
based 
on 
international best practice (IMF, 2011; 
World Bank, 2013; FATF, 2013), 
This 
national 
risk 
assessment 
process will consider money laundering 
risk 
factors 
which 
include 
threats, 
vulnerabilities, and the consequence of 
money laundering. Money Laundering risk 
analysis process is carried out according to 
the type of predicate crime, the profile of 
the perpetrator, the geographical area, the 
industrial sector and typology, including in 
the domestic and foreign spheres (inward 
and outward). Based on the level of risk, a 
domestic and foreign money laundering 
hitmap is then generated which is then used 
as a risk evaluation for the formulation of 
policies and main risk mitigation strategies. 
The methodological approach refers 
to the main concepts, namely threats, 
vulnerabilities, 
and 
consequence 
in 
calculating and analyzing the level of risk 
from various risk contexts for money 
laundering in Indonesia according to the 
type of predicate crime, perpetrator profile, 
geographical area, industrial sector, and 
typology, both domestically and abroad 
(inward risk or foreign predicate crime or 
outward risk or offshore laundering). 
Based on the results of the risk analysis of 
domestic money laundering, the following 
are known: 
1. Corruption and Narcotics are types of 
predicate Crime of ML which are 
categorized as high risk of ML. 
2. Corporations 
and 
individuals

and 
Foreign 
Exchange Traders are industrial sectors 
that are categorized as high risk as a 
means of money laundering offences. 
6. DKI Jakarta is a high-risk area for 
money laundering. 
7. Use of false identities, use of 
nominees, trusts, family members or 
third 
parties, 
property/real 
estate 
including the role of property agents, 


Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | xii

use 
of 
professional services, use of new 
payment methods or systems, use of 
corporations (legal persons), the use of 
sectors that are not well regulated is a 
typology of money laundering in the

Based on the results of the foreign predicate 
crime risk analysis in the scope of FPC 
(foreign predicate crime), the following 
issues are known:

laundering carried out abroad where the 
Predicate Crime occurred in the country 
(Indonesia), it is known the following 
things: 
1. Corruption and Narcotics are types of

With development of technological 
advances and the increasingly complex 
modus operandi of the perpetrators of 
money laundering, the emergence of money 
laundering emerging threats in Indonesia, 
including: 
1. The practice of buying and selling and

During Covid-19 pandemic, Crime of 
fraud, corruption, narcotics, fund transfer 
Crime and embezzlement have a high 
potential risk of money laundering in 
Indonesia. In real terms, there have been 
several cases during Covid-19 pandemic, 
including those related to the crime of 
transferring funds for business transactions 
or Business Email Compromise (BEC) and 
corruption related to the misuse of social 
assistance. 
 
 
 
Based on analysis of the factors driving 
ML 
vulnerability 
in 
Indonesia, 
the 
Indonesian NRA Team has conducted a 
macro analysis through PESTEL analysis 
approach which includes the Political, 
Economic, 
Social, 
Technological, 
Environmental and Legislative aspects 
including legal aspects. Based on the results 
of PESTEL analysis, it is known that there 
are 21 macro-ML vulnerability factors that 
need to be responded to in the form of 
strategic and operational recommendations 
as consideration for the formulation of the 
annual action plan in National Strategy for 
Prevention and Eradication of Money 
Laundering in Indonesia.
"The update of the money laundering risk assessment in Indonesia was prepared based 
on the understanding of the results of the national risk assessment in 2015 and 2019 as 
well as responding to the emerging threat of money laundering and the ongoing 
development of the COVID-19 pandemic situation"

Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 1  
CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Indonesia as one of strategic countries in the world that implements an open financial 
system, so it is extremely interested in maintaining the security and integrity of its financial 
sector. Indonesia continues to be committed to building an Anti-Money Laundering and 
Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation  (AML-CFT) regime. This continues 
to be pursued not only because of his commitment as an observer member of the Financial 
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), but also as the world's collective 
commitment to maintain stability and integrity of the global financial and security system and 
to promote healthy and sustainable world economic growth. Furthermore, it is hoped that this 
commitment will be followed by Indonesia's full membership in the FATF to make a greater 
contribution to a better global financial order. 
As a form of the Indonesian government's commitment to building AML-CFT regime, 
a holistic national Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) has been updated in 2021 with 
stakeholders' AML-CFT who are members of the Inter-Agency Working Group of the NRA 
Indonesia in 2021. This Program is an important and relevant step to respond to developments 
and dynamics at National and international levels concerning efforts to prevent and eradicate 
money laundering. A shared understanding of the risks of money laundering in a holistic 
manner by stakeholders in the AML-CFT regime in Indonesia is very important in determining 
direction, policies and mitigation strategies and must continue to be updated along with 
development and the increasingly complex modus operandi of criminals who use financial 
service providers, providers of goods and services as well as professions that cross the 
boundaries of the jurisdiction of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI). The 
update of Money Laundering risk assessment in Indonesia is prepared based on the 
understanding of the results of national risk assessment in 2015 and 2019 and responds to the 


2 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
emerging threat of money laundering and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation during 
2021.1 
Indonesia's progress in tackling money laundering has been reviewed by the FATF 
based on the results of Indonesia's Mutual Evaluation Review (MER) through Asia Pacific 
Group on Money Laundering (APG) 2018. The MER report measures Indonesia's level of 
compliance with the 40 FATF Recommendations and the level of effectiveness of the anti- 
money laundering system and combatting the financing of terrorism and proliferation in 
accordance with recommendations of the FATF in 2012 and the FATF methodology in 2013. 
This is shown by the score of the results of the Basel AML Index Indonesia assessment which 
in 2018 was recorded at 5.73, down to 4.62 index numbers in 2020. The magnitude of the 
decline in Money Laundering risk score in Indonesia, is driven by considerable progress in the 
assessment of the APG Mutual Evaluation Review (MER) as the FATF regional bodies in Asia 
Pacific Region.2 Indonesia's score based on the Basel AML Index 2018-2020 is described in 
Table 1.

Nevertheless, the results of the 2018 APG Indonesia MER assessment have not fully 
complied with the FATF Standard, including Indonesia has 6 (six) compliant scores 
(Compliant/C), 29 (twenty nine) mostly compliant (Largely Compliant/LC), 4 (four) partially 
compliant (Partly Compliant/PC), and 1 (one) non-compliant (Non-Compliant/NC) concerning 
the target of financial sanctions on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Based on 
the results of the evaluation, there are several recommendations that need to be improved by 
Indonesia, especially in efforts to prevent and eradicate money laundering by applying a risk-
based approach. 
As part of the order of international relations (global) Indonesia is obliged to comply 
with the standards applicable and applied internationally as best practice. FATF through 
recommendation one recommends that each country conduct a national risk assessment. Each 
country is required to identify, assess, and understand the risk of money laundering to then 
develop and implement a risk-based AML-CFT regime (risk-based approach). In addition, with 
the large scope of implementation of domestic tasks and challenges related to Prevention and 
eradication of Money Launderings that have not been fully balanced with uniform steps among 
stakeholders, these are problems that need to be addressed immediately. To respond to these 
developments, strategic innovation of risk mitigation is needed in implementing prevention 
and eradication of money laundering in Indonesia.  
Based on the results of the 2019 ML risk assessment, ML Committee has established a National 
Strategy (STRANAS) for prevention and eradication of money laundering and terrorism 
financing prevention for 2020-2024 which includes: 
a. Strategy 1: Improving the capacity of the private sector in detecting indications and/or 
potential for money laundering, terrorism financing and funding for Proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction; 


4 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
b. Strategy 2: Increasing efforts to prevent the occurrence of money laundering, terrorism 
financing and funding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by applying a 
risk-based approach; 
c. Strategy 3: Increasing efforts to eradicate the occurrence of money laundering, terrorism 
financing and funding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by applying a 
risk-based approach; 
d. Strategy 4: Optimizing asset recovery by applying a risk-based approach; 
e. Strategy 5: Increasing the effectiveness  of targeted financial sanctions in order to disrupt 
terrorism, terrorist activities, terrorist organizations and financing activities for 
Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; 
As a form of implementation of achieving the success of National Strategy, particularly 
strategy 1, Government of Indonesia through the Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and 
Analysis Center (INTRAC) as the focal point in the AML-CFT regime in Indonesia together 
with relevant stakeholders including regulators, self-regulatory bodies, law enforcement 
agencies, private parties or reporting parties as well as associations, experts and academics as 
well as strategic partners abroad have updated Indonesia National Risk Assessment on Money 
Laundering (ML) and Terrorism Financing (TF) as well as Proliferation Financing of weapons 
of mass destruction (PPSPM). ) holistically in 2021. 
1.2 Purpose 
Implementation of updating National Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in 
a holistic manner in 2021 is carried out through a series of processes including risk 
identification, analysis and evaluation. Fulfillment of FATF's recommendation standard one 
concerning identification, assessment and understanding of money laundering risks through 
National Risk Assessment (NRA) activities is an essential part in Implementation of the AML-


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 5  
CFT regime, particularly related to threat factors, vulnerabilities and consequence from legal, 
regulatory, legal enforcement aspects and other aspects to mitigate the risk of money 
laundering. This activity is a strategic measure, especially in providing evaluations of 
likelihood and consequence on risks in determining risk management priorities, mitigation 
strategy steps to reduce risks, as well as resource allocation. Activity of updating National risk 
assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in a holistic manner in 2021 can also assist self-
regulatory bodies, and the industrial sector in conducting their own risk assessment by 
considering the results of this updated national risk assessment. All stakeholders must be 
required to understand the results of the updated national Risk Assessment on Money 
Laundering (ML) in a holistic manner in 2021 and Implementation of internal control or 
internal control, as well as policies and procedures are especially important to mitigate the risk 
of money laundering. 
In particular, the purpose of updating National risk assessment of the holistic crime of 
money laundering (ML) in 2021, specifically aims to: 
1. Identify, analyze, and evaluate various risks of domestic money laundering in Indonesia, 
including types of predicate Crime, perpetrator profiles, industrial sectors, regions, and 
typologies 
2. Identify, analyze, evaluate various risks of foreign money laundering, both inward and 
outward risks, including types of predicate Crime, profiles of perpetrators, and 
geographic areas; 
3. Identify and analyze the threat factors, vulnerabilities and consequence of money 
laundering in Indonesia; 
4. Identify and analyze emerging and/or developing money laundering threats or “emerging 
threats” in Indonesia; as well as 
5. Formulate steps to mitigate the risk of money laundering risk in Indonesia.

1.3 Output 
The update of National risk assessment of holistic Money Laundering (ML) in 2021, is 
expected to produce several important outputs for strengthening the AML-CFT regime in 
Indonesia, including: 
a. The priority scale of the main risk of money laundering at the domestic and foreign levels, 
at least includes the type of predicate crime, the profile of the perpetrator, the 
geographical area, the industrial sector, and typology. 
b. The scale of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequence of money laundering on industrial 
sector groups at risk of misuse of products or services as a means of money laundering. 
c. The scale of the threat, vulnerability, and consequence of money laundering on self-
regulatory bodies, financial intelligence agencies, Law enforcement Agencies and 
relevant stakeholders in regulation and supervision, as well as law enforcement. 
d. New typology trends and money laundering threats. 
e. Directions, policies and steps of National Strategy in Prevention and eradication of 
money laundering in Indonesia with a risk-based approach.

CHAPTER II RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
2.1 Research Method 
The research method used in updating National risk assessment of holistic Money 
Laundering (ML) in 2021 is a mixed method explanatory sequential design. This research 
method is a combination that combines qualitative and quantitative methods sequentially. The 
quantitative approach uses statistical data on reporting suspicious financial transactions, results 
of financial intelligence reports, investigation, prosecutions, and court decisions as well as 
mutual legal assistance in criminal matters (mutual legal assistance). While the qualitative 
approach uses independent assessments by experts or experts from the reporting party, 
supervisors and regulators, financial intelligence institutions (INTRAC), law enforcement, as 
well as political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legislative experts 
concerning the quality of aspects of prevention and eradication of money laundering. 
The guidelines used in updating National risk assessment of holistic Money Laundering 
(ML) in 2021 refer to international best practices in National Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing Assessment (FATF Guidance)3, Risk Assessment Support for Money 
Laundering/Terrorist Financing (World Bank).4 and Review of the funds Strategy on Anti 
Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (IMF)5. The guidelines are also a reference in 
preparation of a national Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in 2015 and 2019.

2.2 Scope and Framework for Risk Assessment 
The scope of National risk assessment of the holistic Crime of Money Laundering (ML) 
in 2021 includes domestic and foreign risks, both inward risk and outward risk. The results of 
National risk assessment of the holistic Crime of Money Laundering (ML) in 2021 were 
obtained from an analysis of the threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. In detail the 
concept of definition used is as follows: 
a. Threats are people or groups of people, objects or money laundering activities that have 
the potential to cause harm (state security and stability). 
b. Vulnerability are things that can be used or support threats, or can also be called factors 
that describe the weaknesses of the anti-money laundering system. 
c. Likelihood is a opportunity about how much money laundering activity occurs. 
d. Consequence is the result or loss arising from Money Laundering on institutions, the 
wider economy and society, including losses from the crime and activity itself. 
e. Emerging Threat is a new threat in the form of a mode that is considered to have the 
potential to develop as a means of widespread money laundering. 
In the guide from FATF Guidance it is explained that risk is a formulation of the algorithm 
function as follows: 
R= f[(T), (V)] x C …………………………………………………… 
(1) 
Remarks: 
R  
: risk, 
T  
: threat  
V  
: vulnerability, and 
C 
: consequence. 
Technically, the formulation of ML risk assessment can be reformulated as follows:

Figure 1 Fomulation of Risk Assesment NRA 2021 
Overall, the description of the concept of a national risk assessment is intended as an input in 
National Strategy for Prevention and eradication of money laundering. National Risk 
Assessment Framework on Money Laundering is described in Figure 2.

The characteristics of ML punishment based on the type of predicate crime are divided 
into 3 (three) including: extraordinary Crime, ordinary Crime without Alternative Dispute 
Resolution for handling criminal cases, and Ordinary Crime with Alternative Dispute 
Resolution for handling criminal cases. In the Ordinary condition with Alternative Dispute 
Resolution, if the criminal process is no longer running because the case is considered to have 
been completed through alternative settlements through administrative or civil settlements, 
then legally the predicate crime is considered completed without going through criminal 
justice.

e. Risk Assessment Method 
After the identification process of the risk-forming factors for each context or PoC (Point of 
Concern) of each identified variable, then in the next stage a weighting technique is carried out 
on these risk-forming factors. The following is the weighting that has been carried out based 
on process Hierarchy Analysis (AHP) approach.

As is known from table 18 above, this weighting is carried out by considering that decision has 
the largest weight, namely 5, while the basis for reporting transactions is the smallest, namely 
1. The court's decision has been legally proven through the investigation process to the court. 
The weighting on the real factor with a weight of two and the self-assessment factor that will 
be used in measuring the potential level with a weight of 1. 
Furthermore, a quantification technique is carried out on each variable by transforming the 
volume of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequence into a scale of 3-9 which shows a low, 
medium and high risk scale. This quantitative transformation is carried out using the min-max 
method. The quantitative transformation is described in figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3 Quantitative Transformation 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 23  
The smallest scale is three and the largest scale is 9, both for the threat, vulnerability and 
consequence variables. In accordance with the risk assessment formula, after obtaining the 
value of the quantity of threats and vulnerabilities, the two are then added together to obtain 
the likelihood value. In accordance with the risk formula, after obtaining the trend value that 
has been transformed into a scale of 3-9, then the trend scale is multiplied by the consequence 
scale to obtain the risk value. The risk value of each PoC is then divided into three levels, as 
follows: 
Table 20  Formulation of Risk Level 
RISK 
VALUE 
RANGE 
RISK 
LEVEL 
EXPLANATION 
7 < x ≤ 9 
High 
Significant amount and value related to money 
laundering; and requires urgent attention 
 
5 ≤ x ≤ 7 
 
Medium 
Significant amount and value related to money 
laundering; and requires continuous monitoring to 
determine the possibility of urgent and/or timely 
escalation of handling required 
 
3 ≤ x < 5 
 
Low 
Low and/or limited amount and value related to 
money laundering; and requires a lower Action or 
a response in the form of monitoring is needed 
 
This evaluation stage contains process of taking the results found during analysis process to 
determine priorities in overcoming risks, considering the objectives of the risk assessment at 
the beginning of the assessment process. This stage also contributes to development of 
strategies for risk mitigation that leads to development of strategies to address risks.

CHAPTER III ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN 
INDONESIA 
3.1 The Legal Framework for Anti-Money Laundering in Indonesia 
Indonesia's position in the framework of compliance with international standards based 
on the FATF assessment since 2001 until now shows a significant step forward in 
Implementation of the AML-CFT regime. This is explained in Figure 9. 
 
Figure 9 Indonesia's Position in the FATF Assessment concerning Compliance with 
International Standards 
Since the inclusion of Indonesia in the Second Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories 
(NCCT's) list6 by the FATF in 2001, it has provided a strong awareness of the importance of 
having a anti-money laundering regime as a national necessity. As a follow-up to the results of 
the first review in 2001 by the FATF, efforts to fulfill the 40 FATF recommendations began 
when Law No. 15 of 2002 on Money Laundering was ratified. However, in Law Number 15 
of 2002, it is considered that there are still weaknesses, among others, as follows:7 
 
6 FATF. Review to Identify Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories: Increasing the Worldwide 
Consequenceiveness of Anti-Money Laundering Measures. Accessed July 19, 2021. https://www.fatf-
gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/2000%202001%20 NCCT%20ENG.pdf. 
7 INTRAC. Compilation of the Law on Ratification of the EDP Convention and International Anti-Money 
Laundering Standards. 2009. 


32 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
a. The threshold of IDR500 million in the definition of proceeds of crime (Article 2) 
provides a weakness that will result in criminal proceeds of less than IDR500 million not 
being prosecuted under this Law. In some countries, the limit on the proceeds of a crime 
is not linked to a threshold. 
b. The limited number of types of predicate offenses in money laundering (predicate 
offense), which is only fifteen types of predicate Crime and the exclusion of gambling in 
the list of types of predicate offenses in money laundering in Indonesia. In this regard, 
the FATF standard states that every country can consider serious offenses to be included 
in the category of predicate offenses. 
c. Submission of suspicious financial transaction reports by financial service providers to 
INTRAC no later than 14 days after the transaction is found to be considered too long to 
allow suspicious financial transactions to be transferred/transferred or withdrawn by the 
service user concerned. 
d. There is no prohibition for financial service providers to notify service users that 
suspicious financial transaction reports are being prepared or have been reported to 
INTRAC (anti-tipping-off provision). 
e. The definition of suspicious financial transactions does not yet contain the element 
“including transactions that use assets resulting from crime.” 
f. International cooperation has not been regulated in detail, even though the FATF 
recommendations contain no less than eight recommendations, both in the framework of 
confiscation, mutual legal assistance, and extradition. 
With these weaknesses, Law Number 15 of 2002 was amended by Law Number 25 of 
2003 on Amendments to Law Number 15 of 2002 on Money Laundering by including several 
material weaknesses in Law Number 15 of 2002, among others: 
a. The IDR500 million threshold has been abolished on the definition of proceeds of crime. 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 33

INTRAC. In addition, INTRAC must refuse and/or ignore any interference from any party in 
Implementation of its duties and authorities. INTRAC is solely responsible to the President of

The efforts to prevent and eradicate Money Laundering use a follow money approach in 
preventing and eradicating criminal acts. This approach is carried out by involving various 
parties (known as the Anti-Money Laundering Regime) each of which has a significant role 
and function, including Reporting Parties, Self-regulatory bodies, Law enforcement Agencies, 
and other related parties. In addition, to support the implementation of efforts to prevent and 
eradicate money laundering in Indonesia, through Presidential Regulation Number 117 of 2016 
on Amendments to Presidential Regulation Number 6 of 2012 on National Coordinating 
Committee for Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering, the establishment of a 
Coordinating Committee has been established. National Money Laundering Committee is 
chaired by the Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security with the Deputy for the 
Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Head of INTRAC as the secretary of Money 
Laundering Committee. This committee is tasked with coordinating Prevention and eradication 
of money laundering. 
The Anti-Money Laundering approach is an approach that complements the conventional 
approach that has been used to combat crime. This approach has several advantages and 
breakthroughs in uncovering Crime, pursuing the results of Crime, and proving them in court. 
With the existence of INTRAC and the Anti-Money Laundering Regime, the goal is to maintain 
stability and integrity of the financial system and assist law enforcement efforts to reduce crime 
rates. 
The Government of Indonesia's progressive and forward steps in its commitment to anti-
money laundering in Indonesia have been proven by the results of decision of the Constitutional 
Court Number 15/PUU-XIX/2021 on the results of the judicial review of Article 74 of Law 
Number 8 of 2010 on Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering (Money Laundering 
Law) which has provided legal certainty and provided the same understanding and commitment 
in the enforcement of anti-money laundering laws. The phrase investigator for predicate Crime 


36 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
in Article 74 of Money Laundering Law provides a broad definition, which includes Civil 
Servant Investigator (PPNS). This progressive decision of the Constitutional Court is especially 
important in the context of optimizing asset recovery resulting from Crime that are included in 
the scope of duties of PPPNS, including Crime in the forestry sector, Crime in the environment 
sector and Crime in the marine sector and fisheries, as well as all other predicate offenses with 
economic motives. Decision of the Constitutional Court has consequence for the explanation 
of Article 74 of the Anti-Money Laundering Law which is interpreted by what is meant by 
predicate criminal investigators are officials or agencies that are authorized by laws and 
regulations to carry out investigation.8 
3.2 Anti-Money Laundering Regime in Indonesia 
The Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and 
Proliferation (AML-CFT) Regime in Indonesia is a series of arrangements and processes for 
Prevention and eradication of money laundering and terrorism financing (ML and TF) Crime, 
which involve all relevant stakeholders including the public. The Anti-Money Laundering 
Regime in the Anti-Money Laundering Law always mandates the importance of inter-sectoral 
or inter-institutional coordination. The coordination is in the form of a comprehensive domestic 
cooperation forum to carry out the handling of money laundering which must be cross-sectoral. 
FATF is a task force formed with the aim of preventing and eradicating criminal acts of money 
laundering and terrorism financing, has issued international standards that become standards 
for every country in Prevention and eradication of money laundering and terrorism financing, 
known as FATF Recommendations. Based on FATF Standard Number 1, it is stated that:

Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 37  
“Each country must identify, assess and understand the risks of money laundering, terrorism 
financing, and financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and must define 
authorities and mechanisms to coordinate action to assess and mitigate risks.” 
Based on the FATF Recommendation, each country must have a national policy that 
must be reviewed regularly and establish an authorized official or have coordination or other 
mechanisms responsible for national policies on Prevention and eradication of money 
laundering and terrorism financing in accordance with information from the results of the 
study, mapping of identified risks and requiring regular review.

financial transactions in the context of optimization prevention and eradication of money 
laundering. In its implementation, the Government of Indonesia through INTRAC has

d. Initiation in Handling Corruption Crime That Harm the State's Economy. 
Initiation in Handling Corruption Crimes That Harm the State's Economy 
 
Handling corruption only focuses on recovering state financial losses, while on the other 
hand, state economic losses due to corruption have not become standard guidelines for 
handling by law enforcement agencies in Indonesia. This causes the level of state financial 
recovery that is often not commensurate with the opportunity costs and multiplier economic 
impacts that arise because of the occurrence of criminal acts of corruption. 
Seeing this phenomenon, the Attorney General's Office in investigating alleged criminal acts 
of corruption in textile imports together with Directorate General of Customs and Excise for 
2018-2020 initiated an approach to calculating the country's economic losses. 
The Prosecutor's Office has named 5 (five) suspects who are suspected of causing harm to 
the state economy in the amount of IDR 1,600,000,000,000,000 (one trillion six hundred 
billion rupiah). The basis for the calculation is based on two elements: 
a. Economic losses from a decline in domestic industrial activity due to a surge in imports 
of the goods under investigation; and 
b. Potential lost household expenditure due to termination of employment from domestic 
industry. 
All these calculations use the minimum irreducible approach, which means that the losses 
incurred cannot be lower than that number but are highly likely higher than that number. 
Initiation in handling corruption cases that focuses on handling cases that harm the country's 
economy is expected to not only encourage the handling of other cases that are detrimental 
to the country's economy, but also encourage improvements in governance in the fields that 
are objects of corruption, and in the long run can increase revenue of state finances and 
economy.

SRA Legal Arranggement Indonesia is a civil law 
country, so there is no legal 
arrangement or trust in 
Indonesia. However, 
Indonesia has identified 
several foreign trust schemes 
that exist in Indonesia. In 
general, the Beneficiary 
Ownership identification 
process for foreign trusts is 
observed to be more difficult 
to uncover. 
On the other hand, several 
trust schemes have been 
identified under the authority 
of other countries but whose 
assets/investments are in 
Indonesia. This scheme is 
hereinafter known as foreign 
trust (foreign trust). 
Indonesia does not allow for 
trusts to be formally formed in 
the country. This results in the

service users of the reporting 
party being only individuals, 
corporations and legal 
arrangements or foreign trusts. 
However, it is possible that 
the entity behind the 
individual or corporation is a 
foreign trust. 
In other words, foreign trusts 
can operate in Indonesia 
indirectly by using 
corporations in the form of a 
Specific Purpose Vehicle 
(“SPV”) or shell companies. It 
is possible that foreign trusts 
can be used to carry out 
money laundering.

Based on the results of identification and analysis of ML risk factors as in the table 
above, a ML hitmap can be drawn up according to the type of predicate offense as follows. 
 
Figure 12 Hitmap by Type of Predicate Crime of Domestic Money Laundering 
Based on hitmap, it is known that the highest risk of Domestic Money Laundering by Type 
of Predicate Crime comes from the proceeds of criminal acts of corruption and narcotics. 
Furthermore, there are criminal acts in taxation sector, criminal acts in the banking sector, 
Crime in the forestry sector, fraud and Crime in the environmental sector identified as the risk 
of money laundering in the medium category. If it is oIbserved that there are several changes 
in the fundamental increase in risk when compared to the NRA2019, which occurs in the crime 
of fraud. This is due to the increasing number of fraudulent Crime that are economically 
motivated and have large economic losses. Judging based on the aspect of the proceeds of crime 
obtained from predicate Crime, it is known that during period 2016-2020 there were 336 
decisions on money laundering cases that have permanent legal force and have been identified 
in the 2021 NRA study showing that the estimated accumulated value of the proceeds of crime 
reaches IDR44.2 trillion. From this amount, the largest crime value was narcotics crime of IDR 


200 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
21.5 trillion (48.67%), fraud was IDR 14.2 trillion (32.08%), and corruption was IDR 5.05 
trillion (11.4%). 
4.1.2 Perpetrators of Money Laundering 
As regulated in Money Laundering Law, legal subjects include individuals or corporations. In 
practice, Implementation of activities or transactions is not only carried out by individuals or 
corporations but also carried out by other legal engagements or legal arrangements where this 
legal arrangement can be carried out by individuals or corporations, usually known as trust 
companies service providers who act for and in the name of the property owner (settlor). 
However, based on the provisions of laws and regulations, other legal engagements cannot be 
formed in Indonesia but there is no prohibition for other legal engagements originating from 
abroad operating in Indonesia so that other legal engagements that are possible can operate in 
Indonesia and become part of the risk analysis process in Indonesia. Judging from 
characteristics of legal arrangements in Indonesia, specific attention is required in terms of law 
and economics. With the legal status in Indonesia as a civil law country, what is meant in this 
risk assessment process concerning legal engagements is more specifically on Foreign Trusts, 
namely trusts created under the laws of one country but managed in a different country.12 
Based on the results of analysis of money laundering, according to the perpetrators, it is known 
that corporations and individuals are a high-risk category for domestic money laundering. 
Corporate actors have a likelihood to be used as a money laundering medium. This condition 
is a challenge for the ease of forming a corporation that has not been followed by an adequate 
verification and supervision process from the authorities. 
Besides that, there is also the convenience of using virtual offices which are usually 
only used to fulfill the completeness of the domicile of the corporation. The majority of those

Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 201  
who are misused are the identities of corporations for account opening for which mining and 
trade-based money laundering (Trade Based Money Laundering/TBML) efforts will be carried 
out with the aim of making transactions originating from the proceeds of criminal acts normal 
and the use of accounts in the name of corporations is usually used to avoid reporting. 
Meanwhile, based on the perpetrators of Crime from individuals who have a high risk due to 
individuals as intellectual actors and professional Money Laundering perpetrator in carrying 
out money laundering activities.

Note: *Occupation Profile category can be included in the Domestic PEP category. 
Based on the laws and regulations in the field of eradicating corruption (Law Number 
28 of 1999 on Implementation of a Clean and Free State from Corruption, Collusion, and 
Nepotism, and the Circular Letter of the Minister of Empowerment of State Apparatus and 
Bureaucratic Reform Number SE/03/ M.PAN/01/2005 concerning LHKPN), as well as 
international standards and conventions in the field of prevention and eradication of Money 
Launderings (FAFT Guidance of PEP) state that Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) include 
state officials who have or have had public authority or an important function is the profile of 
high-risk service users. In the context of the classification of individual job profiles in the table 
above, it is known that Legislative and Government Officials and SOEs / Regional SOEs 
Employees 
(including 
retirees), 
Civil 
Servants 
(including 
retirees), 
Indonesian 
Army/Indonesian National Police (including retirees), Lecturers and Lecturers who are leaders 
of State Universities namely Chancellor of State Universities, Political Party Management can 
be included in the Domestic PEP category. 
Although Political Party Management has a low level of risk of money laundering, the 
vulnerability of money laundering has a significantly high level of vulnerability. In this regard, 


206 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
stakeholders are expected to pay high attention to the profile category of political party 
administrators, in particular, political party administrators who have or have had an important 
role, including the General Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Secretary General and General 
Treasurer both at the central level and regional as well as political party administrators who 
have or have had public authority or important functions as members of the Legislature and 
Government, Regional Heads and Deputy Regional Heads, and Heads of State. 
In terms of differences in Occupation Profile classifications between traders and 
entrepreneurs, it can be clearly identified in the provisions of Law Number 40 of 2007 on 
Limited Liability Companies (UUPT) which mentions the term Board of Directors. 
Furthermore, in the provisions of Law Number 13 of 2003 on Manpower (UUK), Directors 
cannot be categorized as private workers or employees, but are included as entrepreneurs. In 
Article 1 point five of the UUK it is stated that an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur who is: 
a. an individual, partnership, or legal entity that operates a self-owned company; 
b. an individual, partnership, or legal entity that independently operates a company that is not 
his own; and 
c. individual, partnership, or legal entity residing in Indonesia representing the company as 
referred to in letters a and b domiciled outside the territory of Indonesia. 
Meanwhile, the meaning of traders in this Occupation Profile classification is people who 
trade, trade goods that are not produced by themselves to gain a profit, such as wholesalers, 
retailers, shop owners or stalls with small and medium scale businesses. In addition, the profiles 
of individual Money Laundering perpetrator who are most vulnerable as perpetrators of money 
laundering include Legislative and Government Officials, Political Party Management, 
Professionals and Consultants, SOEs / Regional SOEs Employees (including retirees), and 
entrepreneurs/entrepreneurs.

212 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
Furthermore, supervisor immediately acted by holding a meeting with management to 
explain the case and ordered the PJP to stop the virtual currency trading facility. Management 
acknowledged the violation and expressed a strong written commitment to stop facilitating 
virtual currency trading transactions. This action is also accompanied by a supervisory letter 
that prohibits the PJP from processing transactions using virtual currency. The PJP has 
fulfilled all mandatory orders by supervisor within ten days as stated in the letter and has 
also submitted the necessary documents to support completion of all commitments. 
(2) Suppressive Measures by Bank Indonesia (BI) 
From March 2017 to September 2019, Bank Indonesia has identified and followed up 1,090 
KUPVA Non-Bank and 79 PTD Non-Bank that are not licensed in Indonesia. Non-Bank 
KUPVA and Non-Bank PTD have violated the applicable provisions, namely Law Number 
3 of 2011 on Fund Transfer, BI Regulation No. 14/23/PBI/2012 concerning Fund Transfers, 
as well as BI Regulation No. 18/20/PBI/2016 concerning Non-Bank Foreign Exchange 
Business Activities which require Fund Transfer Operators and Non-Bank KUPVA to first 
obtain permission from Bank Indonesia before conducting business activities. Based on these 
findings, Bank Indonesia then closed or directed Non-Bank KUPVA and non-licensed Non-
Bank PTD to obtain permits. 
(3) Suppressive Measures by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)

4.1.5 Money Laundering Typology 
In terminology, the definition of the term Typology is the study of grouping based on 
type or types. While the definition of typology in relation to the AML-CFT regime is defined 
by Asia Pacific Group as a "study of methods, techniques and trends of money laundering and 
terrorist financing" which is a study of the methods, techniques and trends of money laundering 
and terrorism financing. 
Based on several results of international literature studies including the Council of 
Europe Anti-Money Laundering Group (MONEYVAL), EGMONT and Asia/Pacific Group on 
Money Laundering (APG), there are several identifications of typologies that have occurred, 
and development of typologies based on best practices in handling money laundering cases 
internationally. The following are some typologies of money laundering based on a study of 
international literature.

persons), Utilization of sectors that are not well regulated, for example the company does not 
have a good information system or does not even implement AML-CFT procedures where 
there is a requirement in identifying and verifying service users through KYC in the form of

the 2021 NRA period, including: 
a. Strengthening the Guidelines and Regulations on Know Your Customer (KYC) for the 
Industrial Sector. 
b. Expansion of the Reporting Party as regulated in Government Regulation No. 61 of 2021 
on Amendments to Government Regulation Number 43 of 2015 on Reporting Parties in 
Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering. 
c. AML-CFT governance and program arrangements for the use of new payment methods 
or systems (new technology), including Peer to Peer Lending Financial Technology,

(2) Convict Case in the name of NA 
Central Jakarta District Court Number: 123/Pid.Sus TPK/2017/PNJkt.Pst 
NA, an inactive governor of Southeast Sulawesi, was proven to have received gratuities worth 
US$4.49 million or equivalent to IDR40.26 billion from PT RI Ltd. Gratification is received 
from the sale of nickel to PT RI Ltd through an investment in AM. Money was then used to 
make an insurance policy with a periodic premium of IDR 20,000,000,000, per year. In the 
prosecution's case, NA has caused environmental damage in the Malapulu Block, Kabaena 
Island, Bombana District and Buton District. In addition, NA is also considered not to provide 
an example for the community by committing a criminal act of corruption. The Public 
Prosecutor stated that the actions of the non-active Southeast Sulawesi Governor NA related to 
the approval of the Exploration Mining Business Permit (IUP) to PT BI who borrowed the 
name of PT AHB including a corruption crime. According to the Prosecutor, the IUP approval 
was given because NA had malicious intentions to benefit himself, others, and the corporation. 
The permit approval from NA was carried out in cooperation without going through an auction 
process and was carried out jointly with ESDM Sultra BR officials and Director of PT B WA 
by writing a letter in the name of PT AHB. The letter was then followed up with a Governor's 
Decree on the approval of the mining area, which was issued in 2008, so that it seems as if PT 
AHB had applied for and received an area reserve. This irresponsible exploration caused losses 
amounting to: 
1. cost of ecological loss is IDR 1,451,171,630,000. 
2. cost of economic loss is IDR1,246,535,128,000. 
3. Environmental restoration costs amounting to IDR31,038,378,000. 
Money Launderings committed by NA from 2009-2014 include:

• Opening an insurance policy investment using 3 (three) distinct types of identities with 
premium payers from foreign corporations abroad amounting to IDR40.26 billion. 
• Payment of insurance policy premiums from third parties exceeds the policy opening 
value limit. 
• Disbursement of insurance policies expedited before maturity. 
• During process or after the issuance of these permits, along with the management of the

amounting to IDR1,000,000,000 via transfer from CV. FB to the account in the name 
of PT. TM for payment of the purchase of 1 (one) unit of a car previously ordered by 
the Accused through RI and sometime after the issuance of the Decree of the Governor 
of Southeast Sulawesi Province number 600 of 2010 dated 20 September 2010 
concerning Amendment of Production Operation Mining Business License to PT. AHB. 
• On November 29, 2010, NA again received money from ESL in the amount of 
IDR1,315,471,000.00 to Bank M account Number 119-00-0592249-5 in the name of 
RI which was used to pay off the purchase of a house purchased by NA at the Premiere 
Housing Complex. Estate Block I/9 for IDR1,781,000,000.00 (one billion seven 
hundred eighty-one million rupiah) from PT. PQI. 
• On the basis of the issuance of permits to PT. AHB by the Accused by abusing the 
authority, then PT. AHB through PT. BI to carry out mining at the site of the former 
contract of work of PT. IN is so profitable for PT. BI in the amount of IDR 
1,596,385,454,137.00 (one trillion five hundred ninety-six billion three hundred eighty-

 B. The Case of Money Laundering from Narcotics Crime 
(1) The Convict Case in the name of DY 
DKI Jakarta High Court Number: 57/PID.SUS/2019/PT.DKI 
Currently, narcotics cartels are increasingly evolving, starting from producing, distributing, to 
disguising money from selling drugs. One of them is Fredi Budiman’s network narcotics 
syndicate through DY to launder money from drug sales up to IDR6,four trillion. DY has been 
proven to have violated Article 137 of Law 35 of 2009 concerning narcotics and Article 3 of 
Law Number 8 of 2010 on Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering. The mode in 
Money Laundering case is to take advantage of companies engaged in trading and suppliers as 
importers of a number of goods abroad who then falsify or fictitious invoices to make payments 
abroad. In addition, DY also operates six fictitious companies, namely PT PSS, PT UJS, PT 
DJ, PT GU, PT HK, and DV. DY falsified invoices to be able to transact to a number of 
countries including China, India, Japan, Germany, to Australia. In addition, there are also 
indications of a link between this money laundering case and online gambling activities 
involving DY and money changer business. DY used three fictitious companies in online 
gambling cases in 2016. The three companies were reused by DY in conducting money 
laundering. The three are PT PS, PT UJ Sejahtera, and PT HCI. 
In another mode, DY in conducting Money Changer business does not have a permit and uses 
several accounts in the names of other people, namely his employees, which are then used to 
receive money transfers from narcotics ring perpetrators. The employees are asked to go on 
vacation abroad and open an account, which is then controlled and used for the benefit of DY 
as a repository for the proceeds of crime.

Starting from 2012, BS started to carry out plantation activities by seeding oil palms in 
polybags and using an area of 160 hectares. Then in 2016, BS started to harvest Fresh 
Fruit Bunches (FFB) of palm fruit but still in the form of sand (small fruit). Until 2017, 
the Accused started to harvest Palm Fruit Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) by dodos every 2 
weeks with a yield of ten thousand kilograms to 12 thousand kilograms. 
6.  
In addition, in August 2016, the Accused also purchased a Hitachi ZX 110 MF excavator 
to repair roads and clear ditches in the oil palm plantation area. 
7.  
Then on February 28, 2019, members of the Forestry Police at the Center for Security 
and Enforcement of Environmental and Forestry Laws (BPPHLHK) for the South 
Sumatra Region made an arrest of BS because it was based on the results of the overlay 
in the map of the South Sumatra Region Forest and Water Conservation Area of South 
Sumatra Province concerning the Area Forest and Water Conservation in South Sumatra, 
the oil palm plantation area is located in the Lalan Production Forest Area, Mendis Jaya 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 305  
Village, South Sumatra Province. The Accused BS does not have permission from 
Minister to carry out plantation activities in the forest area. 
8.  
After being investigated, it turned out that the Accused BS was using oil palm plantation 
land whose license was still in the name of PT. BPU. The land itself is included in the 
production forest area but the permit for management is in the name of PT. The BPU has 
expired in 2017. Furthermore, the land whose permit has expired then its management 
status becomes KPH (Forest Management Unit) management. Meanwhile, it is forbidden 
to burn forests, trade forest products without documents and transport forest products 
without a permit in forest areas that have become KPH management.

management permits, one of which is PT. BPU, LJM, CBS, BPP and GAL. 
b. Money Laundering 
1.  Money from plantation activities in the forest area is declared as illegal money because 
based on the results of the overlay on the Forest and Water Conservation Area Map of South 
Sumatra Province, the oil palm plantation land is in the Lalan Production Forest Area of 
Mendil Jaya Village in South Sumatra Province. Meanwhile, the Accused BS does not have 
a permit from the Minister concerning the use of this forest area. The Accused himself made 
a transaction by paying cash (currency) by transferring through the XXX Bank account 105-
00-00XXXX-X in the name of BS, among others for: 
a) Buying pesticides;

pilgrims who had paid for the promo package and were scheduled to depart in period from 
November 2016 to May 2017, the departure was canceled. This is because the package price 
of IDR 14,300,000 was not enough to finance the Umrah trip according to the standards offered

estimated to have a shortfall of IDR 5,720,000. It is also reinforced that there is no study related 
to the determination of the promo fee. Moreover, during that time, there was no regulation from 
Ministry of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia concerning the determination of the

IRFAN MAULANA (IM) agreed, because in return he will get a commission of 15% of the 
total funds received. Then a few days later, the first meeting between BA, IM and NURUL 
AINULIA (NA) was held at the Grand Terace of Taman Mini, at that time BA introduced IM 
to NA to discuss the work of establishing a company and opening an account. Then in the

That then around April 2019 a third meeting was held between BA, IM, HB and NA at the 
Grand Terace of Taman Mini to discuss the realization of making a company because JAMES 
EKENE AHODU (DPO) had told NA to create a company with the name CV SEAH M&S, 
CV NINGBO PIA AUTOMATION and CV OPAP INVESTMENT LIMITED because there 
will be money coming in, for that it was agreed to create 3 (three) companies with the 
composition of commissioners and directors namely CV SEAH M&S (Director: IM, 
Commissioner: SUDIHARWATI (SDH), CV NINGBO PIA AUTOMATION (Director: IM,

Serang District Court Number 588/Pid.B/2018/PN.Srg with the convict in the name of CT, 
538/Pid.B/2018/PN.Srg, above name EMK, 510/Pid.Sus/2019/PN Srg in the name of HS, 
539/Pid.B/2018/PN.Srg in the name of DS and 540/Pid.B/2018/PN.Srg 
CT is an entrepreneur who was found guilty of committing a crime of money laundering with 
the predicate offense of transferring funds. This case began with a meeting between CT and 
UCN alias EMK who discussed the business of taking money and sharing commissions in 
withdrawing funds. Then UCN asked CT to open an account for a company called PT Sinar 
Kawaluyaan (PT SK) so that CT contacted DS to open the account. That, furthermore, UCN 


318 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
gave CT an identity card named RA with a photo of DS and an ID card named RH with a photo 
of DJ to CT. The identity card is used by DS to open an account in the name of PT SK. 
Furthermore, UCN was contacted by SMALL Body to ask CT to create a company again and 
open a savings account in the name of PT STI as a place to store funds because some money 
from abroad would enter Indonesia, so CT contacted HS to establish a company and open a 
savings account. That HS agreed to CT's request and asked for IDR20,000,000 for the cost of 
managing the company's establishment. The establishment of the company was carried out 
through a SU Notary in the Serang Banten area under the company name PT Solar Turbines 
Internasional (PT SBI) with the composition of the management and shareholders being HS as 
director and AP as commissioner. After the company was founded, HS opened a bank account 
in the name of PT STI at Bank M KCP Serang Banten. 
On January 4, 2018, there was a transfer of funds amounting to USD3,321,000 or 
IDR43,953,170,300.00 to a Bank M account in the name of PT. STI. This fund is known to 
have come from Gasoducto Del Pacifico Argentina SA TTE GRAL Juan D Peron with invoice 
number 141 10004184 listed. Furthermore, CT asked HS to withdraw money in Bandung so 
that HS Together with AP made a cash withdrawal from PT STI's account amounting to IDR3.9 
billion and directly submitted to CT in Bandung. If HS manages to withdraw all money from 
Argentina, HS will get a fee of 2% of money. Then HS made a transfer to PT SK with a value 
of IDR 20 billion with the underlying payment for a land area of nineteen hectares even though 
there was never any land purchase. That a day later HS intended to withdraw money in PT 
STI's account but at that time Bank M officers informed HS that the account in the name of PT 
SK was invalid and indicated using a fake ID card so transfers could not be made and both 
accounts were blocked. Due to this condition, HS contacted UCN and CT and then UCN 
introduced CT to RW who is the wife of F and RW was willing to aid in opening the blocking 
of these accounts.

4.2 Main Risk Analysis of Money Laundering from/to Overseas in 2021 
The Risk Assessment on Money laundering in the international framework is important 
considering that money laundering is a transnational crime, meaning that money laundering 
can be carried out across countries or jurisdictions, which are not limited to the domestic scope. 
Relationship between the state or foreign jurisdiction in money laundering can be in the form 
of the state as the source of the occurrence of the predicate crime (foreign predicate crime) or 
(foreign inward) or the state as the purpose of money laundering (offshore laundering) or 


322 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
(foreign outward). Thus, an assessment of overseas risk factors for money laundering can be 
made by conducting several key assessments, including the type of predicate crime, the country 
or jurisdiction, the Occupation Profile of the individual perpetrator and the type of Business 
Sector. 
4.2.1 Foreign Inward Risk or Foreign Predicate Crime 
This section is the result of an analysis of the foreign risk of money laundering against foreign 
predicate crime or foreign inward, namely money laundering that occurs in the country 
(Indonesia) where the Predicate Crime originates from abroad. The mapping of foreign money 
laundering offences in this FPC was carried out to analyze the following contexts: 
o. Threats by type of predicate crime from abroad as a source of money laundering in 
Indonesia. 
p. Risk by country or foreign jurisdiction as a source of money laundering in Indonesia. 
q. Risk according to individual Occupation Profile as a means of FPC money laundering. 
r. Threats by type of business sector as a means of FPC money laundering. 
A. Types of Predicate Crime 
Based on analysis of the foreign money laundering threat factors for FPC by type of predicate 
crime, it is known that Fraud, Corruption, Fund Transfer, Narcotics, Electronic Transaction 
Information (ITE) or SIBER are types of predicate Crime of money laundering which are 
categorized as high for Indonesia. In detail, the mapping of the foreign threats of money 
laundering on the FPC according to the type of predicate offense can be seen in detail in Figure 
30. 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 323  
 
 
Figure 30 Foreign Predicate Crime or Inward Levels of Money Laundering Threats by Type 
of Predicate Crime 
This shows that the proceeds of Fraud, Corruption, Funds Transfer, Narcotics, Electronic 
Transaction Information (ITE) or SIBER Crime that occur abroad have a high threat of money 
laundering in Indonesia with FPC mode for the 5 (five) types of predicate Crime, including: 
1. Fraud related to investment fraud, money games, cheating and dishonestly inducing a 
delivery of property, online frauds. 
2. Corruption related to bribery, state losses and management of state assets, pension funds 
involving PEP and other related parties. In addition, there is a mode related to Domestic 
PEP which is reported to be related to casino gambling which indicates the proceeds of 
the source of funds from the proceeds of criminal acts of corruption. 
3. Funds Transfer related to the crime of illegally transferring funds, including the transfer 
of legitimate business transactions or Business Email Compromise. 


324 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
4. Narcotics that involve transactions through other parties including family members in 
Indonesia. The placement of the proceeds of the international illicit narcotics trade is 
carried out by buying property in Indonesia. Based on analysis, there is a link between 
the crime of illicit narcotics trafficking and other Crime, including gambling. 
5. Information on Electronic Transactions or SIBER related to pornography, romance or 
love schemes, fraud activities and online extortion. Based on analysis, there is a 
relationship between forms of cybercrime and fraud from abroad. 
B. Country of Origin for Predicate Offence on ML 
Based on analysis of foreign risk factors for money laundering for FPC according to the country 
of origin of the predicate offence, it is known that Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi 
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are the countries of origin of the TPA that have a high 
risk of ML for FPC. In detail, the mapping of overseas risk of money laundering in FPC by 
country or foreign jurisdiction can be seen in detail in table 37.

Indonesian NRA Team has conducted an analysis through the PESTEL approach. Macro 
analysis that includes Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental 
(environment) and Legislative Aspects (Law). In process of determining the factors driving the 
vulnerability of money laundering on a macro basis through Expert Fact Findings from several 
competent experts in each PESTEL field, which are then relevant to PESTEL Risk Factors and 
NRA Fact Findings in each of the main risk contexts for money laundering. 
Based on the results of the relevance analysis of Expert Fact Findings, 21 macro ML 
vulnerability factors have been identified, including: 
 
 
 


332 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
A. Politic Analysis 
1. Political parties, politicians and state administrators who are politicians and their 
affiliates are vulnerable to being the main source of Money Launderings resulting from 
corruption. 
2. The low quality of financial transaction reports submitted by the reporting party due to 
the weak identification of suspicious financial transactions with indications of predicate 
Crime committed by Politically Exposed Persons (PEP). 
3. Handling of money laundering cases involving state officials and political party figures 
is constrained due to strong resistance and intervention. 
4. The existence of INTRAC which has not fully reached all law enforcement areas in 
Indonesia has resulted in limited outreach in handling money laundering. 
5. There are still individuals who practice judiciary corruption in Law enforcement 
Agencies affecting the effectiveness of law enforcement against money laundering in 
Indonesia. 
B. Economic Analysis 
1. The absence of comprehensive handling of the shadow economy can encourage 
development of the modus and typology of money laundering related to economic 
motives. 
C. Social Analysis 
1. Vulnerable Profile of Workers (TKI or Indonesian Immigrant Workers and 
Professionals) are used in ML mode through transfer of funds and carrying cash across 
borders. 
2. Socio-cultural disorientation that causes various excesses and deviations in people's 
behavior so that they are vulnerable to being exploited in ML mode. 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 333  
D. Technology Analysis 
1. Infrastructure in Implementation of e-KYC has not been fully able to support the 
effectiveness  of efforts to prevent money laundering. 
2. The use of wire transfers between financial institutions is vulnerable to being used as a 
means of money laundering offences to other jurisdictions to avoid detection and 
confiscation of assets. 
3. Digital Money Network or online Platform transactions on online illegal markets by 
professional Money Laundering perpetrator using virtual currency. 
4. Indonesia is the operational target of organizing cybercrime, including cyber fraud or 
transfer fraud and/or transfer of funds. 
5. Development of unlicensed Peer to Peer Lending Financial Technology. 
E. Environmental Analysis 
1. Most of the environmental crime are related to the issuance of business permits and 
misuse of the permits that have been granted.

the mining, electric power, forestry, marine and fishery sectors. 
3. Difficulty in accessing Beneficial Ownership (BO) identification information for 
Overseas Corporations. 
4. Obstacles in establishing cooperation between agencies through MLA related to the 
confiscation of assets resulting from money laundering of environmental Crime abroad. 
5. Oil palm business network (conglomeration) by foreign affiliated business groups

334 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
F. Legislation Analysis 
1. Criminalization or sanctions applied to Persons or Legal Entities that have not been 
consequenceive, proportional and dissuasive. 
2. The absence of a law on asset confiscation has resulted in the asset recovery efforts not 
being optimal. 
3. The supervision of the capital market industrial sector is not yet optimal as well as the 
handling of cases related to indications of money laundering in the capital market sector. 
4.4 Emerging Threat on ML in Indonesia 
In the 2021 NRA study, identification has been made of the emerging threat of money 
laundering, namely a new threat in the form of a mode that is considered to have the potential 
to develop as a means of widespread money laundering. Based on the results of the 2015 ML 
NRA, it is known that virtual currency or crypto currency is an emerging threat in Indonesia. 
This is because the use of Bitcoin in Indonesia has developed in the form of a crypto currency 
that is used for alternative payments for property transactions, luxury vehicles and 
accommodation.16  Various mitigation measures have been taken against the emerging threat 
of money laundering concerning virtual currency or crypto currency, including: 
1. Law Number 7 of 2011 on Currency which prohibits the use of currencies other than 
rupiah as transaction currency for payment purposes. 
2. Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 19/12/PBI/2017 concerning Implementation of 
Financial Technology which states that Financial Technology operators are prohibited 
from conducting payment systems using virtual currency. 
3. Regulation of the Minister of Trade Number 99 of 2018 on General Policy for 
Implementation of Crypto Asset Futures Trading. 
 
16 Indonesia's Risk Assessment of Money Laundering in 2015 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 335  
4. Regulation of Head of CoFTRA No. 6 of 2019 on Implementation of the AML-CFT 
Program related to Implementation of the Physical Market on the Futures Exchange. 
5. Regulation of Head of CoFTRA No. 7 of 2020 on the Establishment of a List of Crypto 
Assets that can be traded in the Crypto Asset Physical Market. Based on these rules, there 
are 229 lists of crypto assets that can be traded on the physical crypto asset market in 
Indonesia.17 
6. CoFTRA has established 13 Lists of registered Crypto Asset Trading Companies 
(Prospective Traders).18 
7. Bank Indonesia, Bali Province, in collaboration with the Police, has taken control of 
Bitcoin ATMs. 
With development of technological advances and the increasingly complex modus operandi of 
the perpetrators of money laundering, the emergence of an emerging threat of money 
laundering in Indonesia. Based on the results of analysis in the 2021 NRA, it is known that 
there are emerging threats of money laundering that have been identified including: 
a) The practice of buying and selling and using accounts in the name of other parties by 
syndicates 
The form of activity in the practice of buying and selling and using accounts in the name of 
other parties can be in the form of: (1) the existence of syndicates that work to find other 
people's accounts and then sell them to criminals who need them, (2) the sale of accounts 
independently because reasons for economic motives, (3) criminals (syndicates) carry out 
social engineering activities and utilize money mule networks.

336 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
b) Misuse of E-Commerce in transaction proceeds of crime 
The form of potential money laundering activities through e-commerce can occur in the 
following conditions: 
• Use of e-commerce platforms as a medium of bribery through the purchase of luxury or 
high end goods; 
• Purchase of goods or services (travel or lodging) of great value to a merchant but no 
delivery of goods only for transfer of funds; 
• Transactions on trade in goods and services on the e-commerce platform have limitations 
in the identification process of the originator name (the owner of the e-commerce 
platform account). 
Furthermore, other threats will develop in the practice of illegal cross-border e-commerce or 
illegal imports on e-commerce platforms that pose a threat of crime and potential state losses. 
The bad consequence of illegal cross-border practices on e-commerce platforms to 
entrepreneurs who hold official import rights and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs). Illegal products that many complain about are prohibited goods (lartas) such as 
Chemicals, Drugs, Cosmetics, and others where these products are imported and circulated 
without permission through e-commerce. This practice will cause many counterfeit and illegal 
products outside of official merchant accounts with much cheaper prices to circulate through 
e-commerce due to not taking care of National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC) 
permit and allegedly not paying taxes according to regulations. In this regard, the Government 
of Indonesia's efforts to protect MSMEs related to products imported from other countries have 
been carried out with the issuance of Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) Number 
199/PMK/010/2019 concerning Customs, Excise and Tax Provisions on Imported Shipments 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 337

4.5 Potential Risks of Money Laundering During Covid-19 Pandemic 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the current outbreak, 
namely Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid -19) is a global pandemic. Covid-19 pandemic has had 
a considerable consequence on the health, social, economic, and financial sectors. Covid-19 
pandemic situation has consequence on the resilience of the economic and financial systems 
throughout the world, including Indonesia. The ability to respond quickly and accurately is the 
main key in dealing with Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, the government must be prepared to 
respond to a series of waves of the current and future Covid-19 pandemic. 
Policies that have been issued by the Government to reduce the consequence due to the spread 
of the Covid-19 virus in Indonesia through the issuance of Government Regulation in Lieu of 
Law No. 1 of 2020 (PERPPU 1/2020) which was ratified in April 2020 on State Financial 
Policy and Financial System Stability for Handling Covid-19 pandemic and/or in Facing 
Threats That Endanger National Economy and/or Financial System Stability. PERPPU 1/2020, 
among others, regulates the reduction of the Corporate Income Tax (PPh) rate for the 2020 tax 
year (SPT PPh submitted in April 2021). Then through PMK-30/2020 the Government 
provided relaxation for delays in excise payments due to logistical delays in the field due to 
Covid-19. Fiscal and procedural incentives in terms of customs and excise are also carried out 
by the Government to reduce the consequence of Covid-19 pandemic which consists of a 
temporary ban on the export of Medical Devices, relaxation of Free Alongside Ship (FAS) 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 339  
Imports, exemption from alcohol excise in the context of handling Covid-19, relaxation import 
permits for Medical Devices, relaxation of import PPh for Ease of Import for Export (KITE) 
companies, acceleration of online services for handling Covid-19, relaxation of excise duty and 
cigarette production, acceleration of logistics with National Logistics Ecosystems (NLE) 
system, and relaxation of sales from a Bonded Zone company or Ease of Import for Export 
Purposes. 
The Covid -19 pandemic has also changed the way people of the world live, including 
Indonesia, one of which is preferring digital payment methods, the trend of online shopping, 
especially using digital payment methods, is increasing. Based on the results of the INTRAC 
study specifically concerning the risk of money laundering related to Covid-19 pandemic in 
2020, it is known that the reporting parties who run face-to-face services for service users are 
as follows: 
 
Figure 36 Services run by the Reporting Party during Covid-19 pandemic period 
Based on the results of the study, it shows that 56% of the reporting parties open some face-to-
face services according to the health protocol, 30% of the reporting parties continue to open all 
face-to-face services as usual by implementing the health protocol, and 14% of the reporting 
parties do not open face-to-face services. 


340 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
 
Figure 37 Types of Digital Services for Reporting Parties during Covid-19 pandemic period 
The types of digital services owned by the reporting party for service users during Covid-19 
pandemic that occurred from March-June 2020 based on the figure above, there are 3 (three) 
types of digital services with the largest percentage owned by the reporting party, namely 
digital applications 37%, mobile banking 16%, internet banking/SMS banking and non-face to 
face money transfer services by 14%. The estimated proportion of transactions made through 
digital services when compared to all transactions that occurred during Covid-19 pandemic 
period is 72% (average number of digital transactions) and 61% (average nominal digital 
transactions). Policies/procedures for implementing CDD/EDD carried out by the reporting 
party for these digital services during Covid-19 pandemic: 
s. Access verification through checking with Data from Directorate General of Population 
and Civil Registration of Ministry of Home Affairs, performing Face Recognition at the 
time of Open Account and if the customer is included in the High-Risk Customer 
Category (PEP), the account opening process will be directed to open an account at the 
Main Work Unit closest to potential customers. 
t. Using standard Covid-19 handling protocols. 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 341  
u. The use of e-KYC as an effort to identify and verify service users online. 
v. CDD is carried out in accordance with applicable regulations. Face to face is done at 
branches and through third parties (for customers who already have an account). 
w. The CDD/EDD procedure is carried out by the Bank Call Staff via video call. 
x. CDD is carried out by the customer sending complete documents via social media/email, 
then identification and verification is carried out by telephone. 
During Covid-19 pandemic, Crime of fraud, corruption, narcotics, fund transfer Crime and 
embezzlement have a high potential risk of money laundering in Indonesia. 
Based on the results of analysis, it is known that the proceeds of fraudulent Crime have the 
greatest potential risk of money laundering, this is due to the large economic need which is the 
consequence of the government's policy of physically closing business activities, causing the 
unemployment rate in Indonesia to increase compared to the previous period. Furthermore, 
Implementation of physical restrictions makes business actors switch to online systems (e-
commerce), due to the significant increase in the need for medical supplies which also makes 
irresponsible criminals take advantage of the situation. This is evidenced by cases of fraud, 
especially online fraud being the most reports received by the Police during Covid-19 
pandemic. Under these conditions, Kominfo (Ministry of Communication and Informatics) has 
coordinated with e-commerce platforms to be able to carry out strict supervision of the sale of 
all products that violate policies and take firm action against such violations. 
Another type of predicate crime that has a high potential for money laundering during Covid-
19 pandemic is corruption. To control the handling of Covid-19 in Indonesia, the CEC has 
issued Circular Letter (SE) Number 8 of 2020 concerning the Use of Budget for 
Implementation of the Procurement of Goods/Services in the Context of Accelerating the 
Handling of Covid-19 related to Prevention of Corruption. Corruption-prone points during the 


342 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
pandemic include the procurement of goods and services, the allocation of State Budget and 
Regional Budget, donations from third parties as well as economic and social handling nets.  
 
Figure 38 Potential Risks of Money Laundering during Covid-19 pandemic Based on 
Predicate Crime 
Narcotics became the third position with the riskiest crime proceeds, where narcotics cases 
increased during the Pandemic, both cases of dealers, those in control, and users. Covid-19 
pandemic has brought up various new modes for narcotics crime perpetrators to involve 
technology, but the police can mitigate and thwart and arrest the perpetrators' actions, both in 
smuggling, distribution, storage, and when transacting. National Narcotics Agency (INNA) 
continues to coordinate with Directorate General of Customs and Excise in carrying out efforts 
to eradicate narcotics Crime. 
Furthermore, policies during Covid-19 pandemic such as social distancing or physical 
distancing caused access to banking and other financial services to become a challenge, the use 
of digital-based transaction services was applied massively to overcome these conditions. With 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 343  
the existence of digital-based transaction services, criminals take advantage of the situation, 
one of which is related to the crime of transferring funds related to the Business Email 
Compromise (BEC). This puts funds transfer Crime at a high risk of money laundering. 
4.5.1 Policy Responses to Money Laundering Prevention and Eradication Program 
during Covid-19 Pandemic 
Several policy responses to risk mitigation carried out by the Government of Indonesia to 
address the potential risk of money laundering during Covid-19 pandemic, whether carried out 
by Self-regulatory bodies, Law enforcement Agencies and other Stakeholders. 
A. Self-regulatory Bodies 
1. Bank Indonesia 
Bank Indonesia (BI) has issued Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 22/7/PBI/2020 on Adjustments 
to Implementation of Several Bank Indonesia Provisions because of Covid-19 pandemic and 
Board of Governors Regulation Number 22/3/PDG/2020 concerning Governance 
(Governance) Implementation of the Continuity of Bank Indonesia's Duties in the Status of the 
Pandemic and National Disasters of Covid -19. Furthermore, BI produces 4 (four) relevant 
outputs, including: 
a. Letter of appeal to Payment System Service Providers (PJSP) Other Than Banks such as 
Fund Transfer Providers (PTD) and Non-Bank Foreign Exchange Business Activities 
(KUPVA), to increase vigilance to anticipate potential ML/TF Crime and other financial 
Crime during the pandemic. 
b. BI issues audit guidelines under certain conditions as a guide for supervisors to continue 
to realize the audit plan. This guideline allows inspection activities to be carried out on-
line/virtual/remote by utilizing the use of information system technology. The scope of 


344 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
these guidelines applies to ML/TF examinations and other risks to support the optimization 
of Implementation of supervisory duties. 
c. BI issues a Guide to Know Your Service User/Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Principles 
which includes electronic CDD (e-CDD) guidelines. 
d. BI issues a policy concerning the use of electronic signatures including for electronic CDD 
for Card-Based Payment Instrument Activities Operators (APMK Organizers). 
2. Financial Services Authority 
Financial Services Authority (FSA) has made various efforts to follow up the consequence of 
Covid-19 pandemic on Implementation of the AML-CFT program in the Financial Services 
Sector. During Covid-19 pandemic period, FSA carried out intensive coordination both with 
internal FSA and also INTRAC as follows: 
a. FSA internal coordination (GPUT and the regulatory and supervisory work unit for the 
financial services sector) on June 4, 2020. 
b. Coordination between FSA and INTRAC on 8 June 2020 (technical level) and 23 June 2020 
(strategic level attended by Head of INTRAC). 
One of FSA's main policies related to Covid-19 pandemic is that Covid-19 pandemic does not 
weaken Implementation of the AML-CFT program in the financial services sector. FSA has 
taken the following steps: 
a. FSA builds a risk-based ML-TF supervision infrastructure (SupTech). The AML-CFT 
Program Information System (SIGAP) is an integrated media in supporting the risk-based 
AML-CFT program monitoring cycle, managing statistical data related to Implementation 
of the AML-CFT program which can also be used to support the effectiveness  of 
implementation (Immediate Outcome). 
b. Optimizing the use of electronic means in communication and coordination. 


 
Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 | 345  
During the work from home and social distancing policies as a response to Covid-19 
pandemic, FSA continues to provide communication services (contact points) and the 
delivery of information related to Implementation of ML-TF to PJKs in the financial 
services sector by optimizing electronic means via e-mail appupptFSA@ojk.go.id and the 
FSA ML-TF minisite. 
c. Increasing the application of the risk-based approach (RBA) in the financial services sector 
FSA encourages the industry to fully implement the RBA in accordance with the ML-TF 
provisions, including: 
•  It is possible to implement a simple CDD in terms of the low risk of money laundering 
and money laundering; 
•  It is possible to apply a delay in completion of verification; 
•  It is possible to implement a non-face-to-face verification process using electronic means 
and by utilizing population data that meets two-factor authentication. 
d. Implementation of Risk-Based AML-CFT Supervision 
FSA continues to consistently implement risk-based AML-CFT supervision in the financial 
services sector. More specifically, supervisors already have a Supervision Protocol in the 
context of Prevention and Handling the Spread of Covid-19: 
•  This protocol aims to provide guidance to supervisors in carrying out their main duties 
and functions amidst the consequence of Covid-19 pandemic on Implementation of 
supervision, including social/physical distancing and the application of work from home. 
•  In general, this protocol regulates on-site audit, off-site supervision, Implementation of 
the Fit and Proper Assessment (PKK), as well as Implementation of panel forums and 
coordination meetings. 
•  In on-site audit, supervisors are advised to temporarily stop inspection activities or can 
continue to run if they are deemed to have high urgency. In the event of suspension, 


346 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
supervisor shall prepare an Examination Progress Report according to the results of the 
last inspection. If inspections are carried out, requests and data collection as well as 
coordination between supervisors and PJK can be done first through FSA-Box (OBOX) 
application, an application that allows Banks to share transactional data and information 
within a certain period of time through a repository. The table in the OBOX application 
is a collection of data submitted by the bank based on risk with certain criteria in the 
OBOX data structure. In accessing the OBOX application, each Supervisory Team is 
given a repository or container with a certain quota to download data and information 
submitted by the Bank. There are two types of data in the OBOX application, namely, 
structured, and unstructured. 
•  The PKK implementation protocol includes the possibility of non-face-to-face PKK 
implementation via video conference, and supervisors are required to pay attention to 
verifying the identity of prospective shareholders or prospective main parties by 
authenticating identity (what you know, what you have, what you are). 
•  Furthermore, Implementation of the Panel Forum and Coordination Meetings of work 
units can be conducted via video conference. 
e.  Use of Digital ID in CDD Process 
FSA encourages the optimization of the use of responsible digital identity and 
Implementation of non-face-to-face verification, and coordinates with Directorate General 
of Population and Civil Registration (Dukcapil) concerning access for FSPs to utilize 
population data in the CDD process. 
f.  Submission of Advisory Alerts to PJK concerning Covid-19 pandemic Conditions FSA, 
both at Head office and regional offices, has delivered advisory alerts in the form of letters

During process of implementing Indonesian NRA2021, there have been various progressive 
developments by the Government of Indonesia in the fulfillment of the Anti-Money 
Laundering program. Indonesia continues to be committed to building a AML-CFT regime in 
efforts to prevent and eradicate money laundering to maintain the integrity of the financial 
system and national security. Various developments (progress) that have been successfully 
carried out by Indonesia, including: 
1.  
Decision of the Constitutional Court Number 15/PUU-XIX/2021 on the results of 
the Judicial Review of Article 74 of Law Number 8 of 2010 on Prevention and 
Eradication of Money Laundering

With development of information technology-based financial services that have the 
potential to be used as a means by criminals to commit criminal acts and to protect 
technology-based financial service providers from the risk of money laundering (new 
technologies for AML), the Government of Indonesia has responded policy through the 
stipulation of Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 61 of 2021

CHAPTER V CONCLUSION OF MONEY LAUNDERING RISK ASSESSMENT IN 
INDONESIA 
5.1 Conclusion 
Based on the results of the identification and analysis of threat factors, vulnerabilities, 
consequence, and risks of money laundering nationally as well as the results of PESTEL 
(Politic, Economic, Social, Technology, Environment, Legislative) analysis on strategic 
driving factors in the vulnerability aspect of money laundering prevention and eradication in 
Indonesia, then the following can be concluded: 
1. 
As a form of the Indonesian government's commitment to building a anti-money 
laundering and prevention of financing terrorism (AML-CFT) regime through updating 
National Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in a holistic manner in 2021 with 
the inter-agency working group NRA Indonesia year 2021. 
2. 
A holistic national Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in 2021 is an important 
and relevant step to respond to developments and dynamics at National and international 
levels concerning efforts to prevent and eradicate money laundering. A shared 
understanding of the risk of money laundering in a holistic manner by stakeholders in the 
Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation  
regime in Indonesia is especially important in determining direction, policies and 
mitigation strategies and must continue to update national understanding as development 
and complexity of the mode of money laundering offences. 
3. 
Indonesia's progress in tackling money laundering has been reviewed by the Financial 
Action Task Force based on the results of Indonesia's Mutual Evaluation Review (MER) 
through Asia Pacific Group (APG) in 2018. The MER report measures Indonesia's level 
of compliance with the 40 FATF Recommendations and the effectiveness  of the system. 


362 | Indonesia Risk Assessment on Money Laundering 2021 
Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation  
in accordance with the FATF Recommendation and the FATF methodology in 2013. 
This is evident from the results of the Basel AML Index assessment since 2018 which 
recorded that Indonesia's score was 5.73 to 4.62 index points in 2020. This condition 
experienced a the large decline in Indonesia's money laundering risk score was due to 
significant progress in the assessment of MER APG as FATF regional bodies. 
4. 
The update of National Risk Assessment on Money Laundering (ML) in 2021 is carried 
out to map authentic knowledge and experience from various elements of the APU 
regime such as the Reporting Party (PP), Self-regulatory Bodies (SRB), Law 
Enforcement Agencies, Association Institutions, and other stakeholders in Indonesia.

and consequence in calculating and analyzing the level of risk from various risk contexts 
for money laundering in Indonesia according to the type of predicate crime, perpetrator 
profile, geographical area, industrial sector, and typology, both domestically and abroad. 
(Inward risk or foreign predicate crime) or outward risk or offshore laundering).
